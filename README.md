## My Development Log
What I have learned and the articles I read:

**20240107**
- Problem solving: attempted to add event listeners to <Sprite>, but it proved ineffective. Discovered the solution in [a forum post](https://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/52525-react-pixi-events-dont-work/).
- Learned: the equivalent of `mousemove` on mobile devices is `touchmove`.
